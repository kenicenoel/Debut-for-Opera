Debut
=====

Welcome to Debut. My name is Kenice and I'm currently an IT undergrad at the University of the West Indies.

What is Debut about?

To put it simply, debut (pronounced Day-b-you) is a new take on the default start page for your web browser.
Chrome, Opera and Firefox all come with their own versions of a default start page that everyone is forced
to use. With debut, everyone can modify the extension to create what suits them but if you are not HTML,
CSS or Javascript Savvy then you can just enjoy the extension as is.

By default, it offers a minimalist, clean design. A welcome change from the default page everyone has.

Feel free to fork the project, mess around with the source code, reuse it and share! Have fun.
